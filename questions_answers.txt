Final Answer: To track how the maximum compute used for training AI systems has evolved, Epoch AI's dataset provides a snapshot of major AI models, offering estimates for training compute, parameter count, or dataset size. This dataset likely reflects the most compute-intensive training runs based on the publicly available information [1][3][7]. However, the dataset's coverage is limited to what can be gathered from disclosures by companies, researchers, and other organizations [6]. Thus, the records are subject to the availability and accuracy of public data, reflecting only those instances where the information has been sufficiently documented and disclosed [4]. \n\nThe time series showing the evolution of maximum compute would highlight notable milestones in AI model training, each corresponding to a training run that set a new benchmark based on the available estimates. As new models are developed and disclosed, they are added to this dataset, providing an ongoing historical record of compute usage in AI training [7].\nReferences: 1. https://epoch.ai/data/large-scale-ai-models\n2. https://epoch.ai/data/large-scale-ai-models\n3. https://epoch.ai/data/large-scale-ai-models\n4. https://epoch.ai/data/large-scale-ai-models\n5. https://epoch.ai/data/large-scale-ai-models\n6. https://epoch.ai/data/large-scale-ai-models\n7. https://epoch.ai/data/large-scale-ai-models\n8. https://epoch.ai/data/large-scale-ai-models
Final Answer: The available references do not provide specific figures for the percentage reduction in Volkswagen's Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 compared to 2021.\nReferences: 1. https://uploads.vw-mms.de/system/production/documents/cws/002/674/file_en/912a475685ada015c1ad3e8c5f193f783bb74b10/2023_Volkswagen_Group_Sustainability_Report.pdf?1710947082\n2. https://www.volkswagen-group.com/en/publications/more/decarbonization-2348/download?disposition=attachment
Final Answer: Volkswagen AG, based in the European Union, meets the specified criteria. It operates within the motor vehicle sector as defined by the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group's (EFRAG) draft guidance and is not a subsidiary since it functions as a parent company with several subsidiaries like Audi, Lamborghini, Bentley, Porsche, SEAT, and Škoda [2][4]. Volkswagen is recognized as the largest car manufacturer globally by revenue, boasting €322.284 billion in 2023 [2]. While Volkswagen provides detailed revenue and production data, the available information does not explicitly confirm whether the company publishes detailed environmental data, including greenhouse gas emissions for 2021, 2022, and 2023 [5]. Therefore, further verification from additional sources would be necessary to fully confirm all specified environmental reporting requirements.\nReferences: 1. https://www.efrag.org/sites/default/files/sites/webpublishing/SiteAssets/Working%20Paper%20Draft%20ESRS%20SEC1%20Sector%20Classification%20Standard[1].pdf\n2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Group\n3. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Group\n4. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Group\n5. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Group
